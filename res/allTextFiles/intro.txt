Welcome, Player, to your Apothecary! 
Your goal is to cure as many customers as possible by creating the right recipes for their ailments. 
You don't have to cure them all, but the more you cure, the better your score! 
When a customer comes in, pay attention to what they say - How they describe their symptoms will help you figure out what ingredients you need to use, and in what quantities. 
Be careful, cause if you get it wrong, you could hurt them! 
If you ever need to know what ingredients you have, type "Ingredients" into the console. 
To see what each ingredient does, type the name of the ingredient (i.e. "honey"). 
To make a Potion, type "add" followed by the ingredient name.
When you are done adding ingredients to your potion, type "Brew".
