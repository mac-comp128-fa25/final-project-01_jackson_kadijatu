Hello, hello! I heard through the grapevine that we have a new apothecary! It's nice to see a new face in the neighborhood. And with perfect timing, too. I strained myself something fierce the other day and I've been mighty sore ever since. You got something that can help? Oh, where are my manners, I'm Nova!
Oh that feels SO much better! I feel like I can get right back to work! Say, you did such a good job with me, I think I'll send my sis you're way. She's stubborn about getting help.
Ah, dang. That didn't seem to do much. Guess I'm stuck healing the old fashioned way, huh?
