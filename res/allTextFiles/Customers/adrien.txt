*Yawn* You're the newest apothecary, right? Sweet. I'm Adrien. A- *yawn* Ava told me you were able to cure her, so I figured you could help me too. I've been having some trouble sleeping lately cause I run kinda hot. Haven't had a good nights rest in a while. I used to try drinking a warm cup of milk since people say it helps, but I got tired of the taste REAL quick. Think you can come up with something better?
Oh wow, already feel so much cooler. Is this what it's like to have a normal body temp? I can feel myself getting sleepier, too. Thanks for this!
Somehow, I'm running hotter after that than I was before. What a bummer. I'll get outta your hair then.
You put some kinda milk in here, didn't you? I get it, it's supposed to be good for sleep, but I don't think I can drink this. Thanks anyways.
