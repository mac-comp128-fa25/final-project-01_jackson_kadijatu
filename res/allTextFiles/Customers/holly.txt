Dialogue:
H-hello? Oh, Hi! I'm Holly, I work at the bakery a few doors down. We've been experimenting lately, trying to come up with new goods, and I think I've been sampling a bit too much. I've got a bit of a toothache that won't go away. Figured I'd get something for it before it got too bad, y'know?
This is perfect, thank you! Feel free to stop by the bakery for a treat sometime, it'll be on the house.
Hmm... Nope, still hurts. No, it's alright. I'll just have to be more careful with my sampling. The last thing I'd want is to have to see a dentist.
