Hey, this is that new apothecary that just opened up, right? Lucky break! Names Shawn. I've had a pretty severe cough the last few nights, bad enough that it keeps me from sleeping at night. You got anything that'll calm it down? It'd be much appreciated.
Thanks a bunch! I can already feel my lungs calming down.
Yeah, I don't think that's doing anything. Thanks anyways for tryin.
